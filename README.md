##What does this do:

1.If you are looking to receive quick feedback on your ideas and have a group of helpful, savvy and cooperative people also bubbling with innovative and original ideas wanting sharing similar intentions, look no further! You can even choose to attach an image to your query!

2. if ya seeking a great Python framework to start making telegram bots, Telepot is fantastic. this script might be useful to grasp the basic functionalities (chat/event handling and inline keyboards/buttons) as there aren't many tutorials for beginners.

Feel free to use/learn from it

##More details on what it does: (instructions on /start)
- Post queries which people can respond to anonymously/privately in a separate room because anonymity is likely to encourage 		honest feedback.
- Retrieve list of your OWN queries and their respective responses 
- Rate people's ideas and even add feedback by clicking on query in the channel.
- Optional: Attach images to your queries
- Admin has access to a Google sheet of responses. (sort of acts as a DB. downsides: slower than a DB)


#Things you wld need b4 running the script:
- Google sheets API_KEY (oauth2client)
- Telegram channel with the bot and ur pals added in it
- Python packages: telepot v9, gspread 
- Telegram bot API_KEY



Note: currently not sure if this is the latest/working version, randomly found it collecting dust in my Desktop so making it useful by sharing publicly. Haffun
